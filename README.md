Retrieve an itemised breakdown of transactions at Woolworths made with your Up Banking Account. This is a
_proof-of-concept_ & the graphic below is a _fantasy_ of how I imagine digital receipts could be presented in-app:

## motivation

> _"My bank app tells me I spent $19.00 at the grocery store... I wonder what I bought..."_

I predict that banking apps will one day provide customers with itemised receipts in-app.   
It's a big call but when I look into my crystal ball I see that;

* Point-of-Sale and payment providers will host the digital receipts/invoices of the transactions you've made with your
  bank card.
* Square, Tyro, Stripe, PayPal, etc. will offer secure APIs to pull invoice data as part of the
  [Consumer Data Rights (CDR)](https://www.cdr.gov.au/what-is-cdr) initiative.
* Banks, financial-wellbeing services, & other FinTechs will bridge invoice data with banking data - thanks to CDR &
  [Open Banking](https://www.ausbanking.org.au/priorities/open-banking/).

The FinTech space is generating a lot of interesting products around the idea of financial-wellness. Up, Douugh, Frollo,
WeMoney, and other platforms offer tools to track spending habits - some using "AI" & data-driven tools to help
consumers. Surely, these platforms would benefit from having greater granularity to purchases; it is hard to distinguish
purchase behaviour from knowing only the vendor & not the items.

I wanted to make a proof-of-concept using Up Bank's well-documented API & one of, if not the largest Australian grocer:
Woolworths. In short, Woolworths' Everyday Rewards API is closed-source & painful to look at. However, they do provide
customers with ‚ú®e-receipts‚ú®, which is more than I can say for their competitor, Coles' FlyBuy program.

## requirements

* You're an [Upsider](https://up.com.au/) ‚ö°
    * You have an account with Up Bank & you've used this to purchase from Woolworths.
* You have an [Everyday Rewards](https://www.woolworthsrewards.com.au/) account
    * Which you've remembered to use when purchasing from Woolworths with your Up Bank account.

## getting started

1. Head to [Up Banking's API](https://developer.up.com.au/#welcome) page & grab your personal API token
2. Login to [Woolworth's Everyday Rewards](https://www.woolworthsrewards.com.au/#login) site & navigate around with
   dev-tools monitoring network traffic. Filter network traffic with `api.woolworthsrewards.com.au` & find any request
   that has `client_id` & `authorization` headers.
   <p align="center">
    <img src="/imgs/headers.jpg" />
   </p>

   N.B. the authorization bearer token expires after 30 minutes; you'll need to repeat the process if that occurs. It's
   pretty frustrating but if you think you can help improve this please [help wanted](#help-wanted) section & reach out.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` & place those three tokens inside:

```
WOOLIES_CLIENT_ID=cXDN...
WOOLIES_TOKEN=8h41...
UP_TOKEN=up:yeah:1234abcd...
```

4. Run `src/up_woolies/main.py`, look around & have some fun!

```
$ python main.py

{'date': '2020-12-31T10:13:58+11:00',
 'items': [{'amount': 0.94,
            'description': 'Tomato Truss Red',
            'quantity': None,
            'weight': 0.242},
           {'amount': 2.39,
            'description': 'WW Drought Relief Whole Milk 2L',
            'quantity': 1,
            'weight': None},
           ...
```

## help wanted

I'd love help with handling Woolworth's authentication process üîê I spent quite some time trying to understand how
Woolworth's authentication endpoint operates - reading client-side js files, figuring out their device-fingerprint
workflow, trying to see if it matches up with some common OAuth practice.  
Obtaining a user's `client_id` & `bearer token` via `accounts.woolworthsrewards.com.au/er-login/validate-user` from
their `email` & `pass` is the ultimate goal. Any help would be great; I'd love to learn how that works.

I'm holding out for Up Bank to provide API support for 2Up (& multiplayer when that is released). You can help by
reacting to the pending [feature request PR](https://github.com/up-banking/api/issues/84) and, if you're an Upsider,
suggest the feature through support chat in-app üôè

## the graveyard of ideas

* üèß Support OpenBanking API - _aka_ support for all banks!
    * I noticed a purchase that I made with Westpac rather than Up, and after looking through Frollo & CDR I realised
      that many more banks had begun supporting Open Banking than when I last checked.
    * Unfortunately, despite the title _"Consumer Data Rights"_, the process of authenticating myself with these CDR
      data holders for my _own_ consumer data is a mystery to me. If you know, then please reach out to me.
* üë©‚Äçüíº Talk to someone about Woolworths' API
    * I tried reaching out to Woolworths to talk about their API: EverdayRewards support, Quantium (the tech subsidiary
      managing the program), even cold-messaged people on LinkedIn associate with WooliesX. No luck.
* ‚ö° Talk to someone about Up Bank's smart receipts
    * A friend pointed out on [The Tree of Up](https://up.com.au/tree/) a leaf call _smart receipts_ & the existing
      integration with AfterPay. It would be interesting to hear how it was implemented, & if this proof-of-concept
      shares any similarities.
* üë´ Support 2Up
    * Please read [help wanted](#help-wanted) on how you can help push for API support of 2Up.
* ‚öñ Interpret item weights
    * Weight values are currently supporting deli items only; however, most items include there weight in the item
      description. It's straight forward to implement - some regex here & there.
